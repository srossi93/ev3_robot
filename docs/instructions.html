				<h2>Movement</h2>
        <p>The robot embeds two <em><a href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/drivers/tacho-motor-class/">tacho class engines</a></em>,
          which can be programmed using commands to the relative drivers. </p>
        <p>The issue with engines and movement in general is the big statistical variance
          of results of the same command performed on different environments. For instance,
          turning around on a carpet or in perfectly smooth floor has different effects due
          to the inertia attenuation of the two materials. So, the question we asked ourselves
          is: how can we be sure to obtain the expected result?

				<p>The simplest model to describe the dynamic behaviour of the position of
          the robot is presented in the following formula:</p>
          <div class="box alt">
            <div class="row uniform 50%">
          <div class="7u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dc_engine.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
          <div class="5u"><span class="image fit"> $$ T(s) = \dfrac{1}{s^2+2s+1} $$
            <p>Of course, this is a simplistic rappresentation which does not take into account a lot
              of parameters and features of the real system under test: it's in just the basic
              model used to evaluate different control strategies.</p><p> The plot on the left shows the
              response of the model to a constant input (which in our case rappresents the evolution of
              the position over time).
             </p>
           </span></div>
          </div></div>
          <p>To implement this control, we used a well known stategy in control theory: a proportional
            feedback in closed-loop.
            <center><div class="5u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/closed_loop.png" alt="" /></span></div></center>
            This structure, since it doesn't add zeros or poles, for positive value of K, the system is always observable,
            controllable and stable. In fact, if a system defined by a transfer function
            $$ T(s) = \dfrac{1}{\prod_{i=0} ^ n (s-z_i)} $$
            using proportional controller, the complete system is stable
            $$ H(s) = \dfrac{K T(s)}{1+K T(s)} $$
          </p>
          <p>In our implemetation, we simply choose K = 1 (i.e. the engine is driven by the error itself).</p>
